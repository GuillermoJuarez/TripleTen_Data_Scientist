# Data:

* Characteristics: gender of the insured person, age, salary and number of family members.

# Taks:

* Task 1: Find customers who are similar to a given customer. This will help the company's agents with marketing.

* Task 3: Predict the number of insurance benefits that a new client may receive using a linear regression model.
* Task 4: Protect customers' personal data without affecting the model from the previous exercise.
