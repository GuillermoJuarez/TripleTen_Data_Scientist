# Data:

Technological process:

* Rougher feed — raw material
* Rougher additions (or additions of reagents) - flotation reagents: xanthate, sulfate, depressant
* Xanthate — floatation promoter or activator
* Sulfate — sodium sulfide for this particular process
* Depressant — sodium silicate
* Rougher process—flotation
* Rougher tails — product residue
* Float banks — flotation facility
* Cleaner process — purification
* Rougher Au — rougher gold concentrate
* Final Au — final gold concentrate

Stage parameters:

* air amount — volume of air
* fluid levels
* feed size — size of feed particles
* feed rate

Designation of the characteristics:

This is what the features are called:

* [stage].[parameter_type].[parameter_name]

Possible values ​​for [stage]:

* rougher—flotation
* primary_cleaner — primary cleanup
* secondary_cleaner — secondary cleanup
* final — final characteristics

Possible values ​​for [parameter_type]:

* input — raw material parameters
* output — product parameters
* state — parameters characterizing the current state of the stage
* calculation — calculation features

# Goals:
